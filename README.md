# Momento Go-Redis Compatibility Client

## What and Why?

This project provides a Momento-backed implementation of [go-redis](hhttps://github.com/redis/go-redis)
The goal is to provide a drop-in replacement for [go-redis](hhttps://github.com/redis/go-redis) so that you can
use the same code with either a Redis server or with the Momento Cache service!

You can use Momento as your cache engine for any Go project that support a redis-backed cache.

## Usage

- To be added once APIs are implemented. Currently no APIs are supported
